## Agenda Items and Resolutions

### 1. Feedback
- “Please can we not have pizza and soft drinks after each event? we shouldn't contribute to our society's growing health problems :) other than that, everything is great thank you”
	- **Resolution:** Not economical + always welcome to bring your own food (but we will consider more healthy options for hackathon)
- “More pizza”
	- **Resolution:** We try to get as much pizza as financially feasible.
- “I think some more beginner oriented events would be great”
	- **Resolution:** We try to cater to a wide audience (1st to 4th years) and we try to have all members interested in events and minimise coursework conflict. Most events assume atleast knowledge of first semester content and there is no plans to change that.
- “Docs to setup and contribute to UQCS Projects”
	- **Resolution:** 
		- Tom to add comments/setup instructions for payments system and shirts system
		- Dragan to add comments/instructions for website


### 2. Review of Sponsors
- Add sponsor logos to website


### 3. Events
```Redacted.```

### 4. Misc.
- Potentially change website from Jekyll to Frozen-Flask to make it more friendly to beginner students.
