## Agenda Items and Resolutions

### Sponsorships

- Discussed which companies and organisations that we would reach out to in order to secure sponsorships

### T-Shirts

- Noted that vendors include: Spreadshirt, Teespring, We Don't Like Mondays, Red Octopus
- Decided to defer the choice of vendor, so that we could ask the society if they know of ways to get cheap, quality shirts
- Demanded cooler shirt designs, deciding that more shirt designs should come from the community

- Discussed:
    + who would be assigned/responsible for each event
    + what each event would concern

### Events after the first 6 weeks
