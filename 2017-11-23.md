- Stressed the need to ensure equal distribution of work between all members of the committee
- Stressed the need for deadlines and team collaboration to ensure committee remains productive
- Considered the need to use GitHub to manage responsibilities
- Considered the need to assign responsibilities with respect to:
  + Channels of feedback

  + Social media
  + Events

### Rebranding

- Stressed the need to standardize and flesh out our brand identity
- Stressed the need to correct asymmetry issues with the logo

### Student run events

- Looked at reducing barriers of entry to run talks

### Social media policy

- Expressed concern that all social media avenues (website, calendar, Twitter, Slack, Facebook group, Facebook page) receive varying degrees of attention and posts
- Noted that significant numbers of Slack members don’t like the Facebook group and page, meaning that they do not receive event notifications
- Considered possibly automating the process of posting to social media
- Considered the need for an `@channel` in `#announcements` with respect to liking the Facebook group and page
- Considered the need for “How to get involved in UQCS” flyers to be distributed on market day to ensure that social media channels remain open.
